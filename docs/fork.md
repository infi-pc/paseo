# Maintaining the fork

This repository is Michael's long-term personal fork of Paseo. The policy (what the fork optimizes for, English-only copy) lives in the top of [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). This doc owns the mechanics: which branch is what, how to sync with upstream, and how to keep the fork's footprint visible so each sync stays cheap.

## Branches

| Branch                 | Role                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `upstream/main`        | getpaseo/paseo. Read-only.                                                                            |
| `main`                 | Exact mirror of `upstream/main`. Never commit here; it only moves by fast-forward. Tracks `upstream`. |
| `paseo-customizations` | The fork. Every fork commit lives here or on a feature branch that merges here.                       |

Keep `main` a pure mirror. That is what makes `git log main..paseo-customizations` and GitHub's compare view answer "what has the fork changed" without guesswork. `backup/main-before-upstream-reset-*` exists because `main` once carried fork commits and had to be reset.

## Sync with upstream

Run this when upstream has moved. Start with the report so you know what you are walking into:

```bash
npm run fork:status
```

It fetches upstream and prints the lag of both branches, the fork-only commits, the fork footprint by package, upstream churn inside files the fork also modifies, and the result of an in-memory dry-run merge with the files that would conflict. Nothing is written. `--json` gives the same data for scripts.

Then sync:

```bash
git checkout main && git merge --ff-only upstream/main && git push origin main
git checkout paseo-customizations && git merge main
# resolve conflicts, then:
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format
git commit
```

Merge, don't rebase. `paseo-customizations` is shared across worktrees and origin, and its merge history is the record of what each upstream sync cost. If the dry run shows more than a handful of conflicts, do the merge in a throwaway worktree (`git worktree add /tmp/paseo-merge -b tmp/merge paseo-customizations`) so the main checkout and the dev daemon keep working while you resolve.

Conflict rules:

- Keep both sides. Upstream's change never gets dropped to make a fork feature fit; the fork feature gets re-applied on top of upstream's new shape.
- Non-English locale files: keep upstream's text and whatever fork blocks are already there. The fork does not maintain translations, so a fork key missing from `es.ts` is expected. That is why `TranslationResources` in `en.ts` has optional leaves and the locale files use a trailing `satisfies TranslationResources` instead of an annotation; keep that shape when upstream's header conflicts with it.
- A file upstream deleted and the fork edited: accept the deletion unless the fork edit was the only coverage of a fork feature.
- Finish with the repo checks in the task's package, then the targeted tests for every file that conflicted. Never run the full suite locally.

After the merge, run `npm run fork:status` again. The conflict list should be empty and the merge base should be the new upstream head.

## Sync history

One row per upstream sync. Record what conflicted and what the merge broke silently (auto-merged code that typechecked or tested wrong), so the next sync starts from the last one's lessons.

| Date       | Upstream head | Fork commits | Conflicted files | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-09-24 | `e3c853df5`   | 25           | 37               | Merge `c97e1eb10`. Silent breakage: upstream's timeline projection collapsed tool-call rows so summary targets lost their seq (`agent-timeline-store.getRow`), upstream's exhaustive `diff-sharing.test.ts` demanded equality checks for fork fields, and a new layout-store test did not expect the fork's default chapters tab. Complexity lint tripped on four merged functions. |

## Keeping the footprint small

Each upstream file the fork modifies is a future conflict. Fork-owned files never conflict. When adding a feature:

- Put the feature in new files (a service, a schema module, a component) and touch upstream files only for the wiring: an import, a registration, a menu item, a feature flag.
- At every wiring site in an upstream file, leave a `// FORK(<feature>):` comment. `rg "FORK\("` then lists the fork's intrusions the same way `rg "COMPAT\("` lists shims, and a reader resolving a conflict knows which side of the hunk is fork code without opening git history.
- Prefer upstream's extension points (plugins, feature flags on `server_info.features`, provider registries) over editing core files. When a fork feature needs a protocol change, follow [protocol-compatibility.md](protocol-compatibility.md) as if upstream clients would talk to this daemon; the desktop app and the phone often run different builds of this fork.
- Do not fix upstream bugs on `paseo-customizations` unless they block a fork feature. Send those upstream; the fork inherits them on the next sync without carrying a diff.

## Feature ledger

One entry per fork feature: the commits that built it, the files that own it, and the upstream files it wires into. Update it when you add or remove a feature. The hotspot lists are the files to read first when `fork:status` reports conflicts.

Commits are the fork commits that built the feature (`git show --stat <sha>` for the full file list). "Owns" lists the fork-owned entry points. "Wires into" lists the upstream files the feature edits, largest first.

### Shared hotspots

Upstream files that three or more features edit. These conflict on most syncs; read them with `git log -p main..paseo-customizations -- <file>` before resolving.

## Review artifacts

`findings/` holds review-loop output for fork work (`CR*.md` reviewer findings, `FIXES-*.md` fix records, `evidence/` CI logs and screenshots). It is fork-owned and never conflicts. Delete a set once its branch has merged and the findings are resolved; the ledger above is the durable record.
